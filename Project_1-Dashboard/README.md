![Recording of dashboard showing use of data validation to make dashboard responsive to user input.](<Dashboard recording-1.gif>)

## Introduction
This data jobs dashboard was designed to investigate salaries for data jobs across different countries. The data is from Luke Barousse‚Äôs Excel course which provides a foundation in analysing data using this powerful tool. The data contains real world job information from 2023. It contains detailed information on: 
- üë®‚Äçüîß Job titles,
- üíµ Salaries, 
- üìç Locations and 
- üíª Essential skills 

## Dashboard File
My final dashboard is in Link

## Excel Skills Used
The following Excel skills were used in the analysis
- üìà Charts
- üìê Formulas and functions
- ‚úÖ Data Validation

## Project Build
### üìà Charts: 

**Bar Chart: Salary by Job Title**

- **Excel Features:** Used bar chart features with formatted salary values and optimised layout for clarity. Maintained differing colour scheme for ease of readability for people with visual challenges.  
Design choice: Horizontal bar chart for visual comparison of median salaries.  
- **Data organisation:** Sorted by descending salary for ease of readability.  
- **Insights gained:** This enables quick identification of salary trends noting that senior roles and engineers are higher-paying than analyst roles.  
  
  
**Map Chart: Country Median Salaries**

- **Excel features:** Used the Excel map chart feature to plot salaries globally.  
- **Design Choice:** Map chart allows the user to easily see disparities in salaries across regions.  
- **Data Representation:** Plotted median salary for each region  
- **Insights Gained:** Visually highlights high and low salaried regions for each job title and Country. 

### üìê Formulas and Functions  
**Calculating Median salary by Country, Job Title and Job Schedule Type**  
```
=MEDIAN(
  IF(
  (jobs[job_title_short]=A2)*
  (jobs[salary_year_avg]<>0)*
  (jobs[job_country]=country)*
  (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(type,jobs[job_schedule_type]))),
  jobs[salary_year_avg]
  )  
)  
```
- **Multi-Criteria Filtering:** The calculations are filtered by job title, country, schedule type and excludes blank salaries.  
- **Array formula:** Uses MEDIAN() function with nested IF() to analyse an array.  
- **Tailored insights:** This enables the dashboard to provide specific salary information tailored for the selected fields.  
- **Formula Purpose:** Formula populates the salary tables, which provides the data for the dashboard charts. An example is given below:   

**Salary by Job Title table**

### Simplifying Job Schedule Type  

```
=FILTER(J2#,NOT(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("and",J2#)))*(J2#<>0))
```
- **Unique list generation:** This formula utilises the FILTER() function to simplify a complex list of Job Schedule Types, excluding all types that included "and" or were blank. (e.g. Full time and part time)  
- **Formula purpose:** To simplify the input for analysis and the data validation on the dashboard.  
- **Analysis:** The Median salary calculation then uses the SEARCH() function to account for part Job Schedule Types in the analysis.  

**Background Table** (Showing part of the pre-simplified list and the resulting simplified list):

### ‚úÖ Data Validation
Implementing Data Validation rules for entry of Job Title, Country and Type in the Dashboard ensures:  
- Accurate data entry on the dashboard  
- Minimisation of errors  
- Enhanced usability of the dashboard

## **Conclusion**  
I created this dashboard using real-world data on salaries to explore salaries in data related jobs. It highlights my skills in formulas and functions, charts and in data validation. I look forward to solving more problems and learning more data analysis skills.
